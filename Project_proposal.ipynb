The Covid Act Now API provides us with comprehensive COVID data for all US states. The API is available in JSON and CSV Formats. \n",

    "* ##### 1st Part:\n",
    "    1. First, we will use the COVIDAct Now's data for our initial data analysis. EDA analysis: we will extract the dataset from the website and store it on a data frame. We will analyze any missing values in the dataset and consider whether missing values are essential to our research. If not necessary, the missing values will be deleted.  Then we can analyze each attribute by viewing basic statistic descriptions and generate various sorts of graphs for our categorical and numerical data types for further research. \n",
    "    2. For our categorical data, we will use bar plots and histograms, and for our numeric data, we will use scatter plots, line graphs, and box plots. Also, we can build data visualization interfaces by using DASH to make our research more interactive and vivid.\n",
    "    3. We will analyze which states had the highest deaths, cases, hospitalizations, and ICU details.\n",
    "    4. We will also analyze which states are vaccinating their people and are on their way to make a safe environment for their people on a 'state' level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* #### 2nd Part:\n",
    "    1. We will use twitter to do sentiment analysis of people's views, thoughts on COVID-19.\n",
    "    2. We will also make attributes for both positive and negative thoughts/words and also analyze on a geograhic level which country was most tweeting about COVID-19.\n",
    "    3. We will then also analyze were users from U.S were ready for COVID-19 or not."
